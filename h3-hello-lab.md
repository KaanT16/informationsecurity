#h2 a) Can't fish

I used 'nmcli networking off' command to close the network it worked. After that I used 'ping 8.8.8.8' and I got a 'Network is unreachable' message. After that I used 'nmcli networking on' command to enable my networking. After I enabled my network and used 'ping 8.8.8.8' I got some returns with my ms and some other things.

#h2 b) Local only

After I closed my wifi and installed nmap I runned 'nmap localhost' command and got some feedbacks and here are they:

Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)

Other addresses for locahlhost (not scanned): :1

Not shown: 999 closed tcp port (conn-refused)

Port state service

631/tcp open ipp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.07 seconds.

#h2 c) Daemon scan

I couldn't made the daemon scan because I got a problem at installation

I had already done it on the first day as I remember so that was also done.
